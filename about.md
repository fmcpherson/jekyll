Hello, I am Frank McPherson, and I welcome you to this web site where I host essays and other long form articles that I write.
This is the third location for host this format of my writing, for by past writing, in reverse chronological order please go to:

* [Let's Be Frank](http://writing.frankmcpherson.org)
* [Webnotes](http://webnotes.frankmcpherson.net) and [Stories](http://stories.frankmcpherson.net)

Currently I blog at [frankmcpherson.blog](https://frankmcpherson.blog) and [the-narthex.org](https://the-narthex.org) and I also have a site dedicated to [Real Personal Computing](https://realpersonalcomputing.com). 
You can find me on Twitter, Facebook, and Google+ but rather than seek me out in all those locations you can find my
social network posts at [fjmnotes.com](https://fjmnotes.com).

Finally, to see my personal profile, please go to [frankm.org](http://frankm.org).

I wrote my Chrome OS piece in Drafts intending to publish it to my long form writing site that uses Jekyll. Previously I used a [Jekyll formatting action](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1GO) in Drafts that not only created the Jekyll top matter but also stored the content in my Jekyll repository in Working Copy. Something has changed that prevented the action from writing that item to Working Copy, so I had to manually Share a copy to the Working Copy repository.

Oddly enough, when I used the same action to format this article the action successfully stored to Working Copy, so I don't know what is going on!

[As I wrote previously](https://writing.frankmcpherson.net/computers/2018/10/31/time-for-new-computer.html), over the course of six weeks I considered several different Chromebooks before deciding to buy the Google Pixelbook. On this page I am going to document my experience with setting up and using the Pixelbook, you can see my raw notes in [my Work Notes outline](http://instantoutliner.com/41).

## Out Of Box Experience
Google, like most hardware companies, copies Apple in their out of box experience, investing in the packaging. In the end there isn't much in the box, the Pixelbook, power supply, and that's it. The box, and its form fitting insides, is destined for the recycle bin.

The quick and easy set up process is a strength for Chrome OS. I logged in using my Google credentials and my past Chrome OS apps appear in the Launcher. On the other hand, it would be nice if there were a way to tell Chrome OS to boot up with a clean experience and remove prior installed apps. Most of the Chrome OS apps I have on my account are things like terminal and editor apps that I will likely replace with Linux or Android apps.

I don't know which version of Chrome OS was originally installed on the Pixelbook because the update began pretty quickly. Right now I am running version 70. 

## Managing Applications
CrOS 70 has a shelf that is equivalent to the Mac OS dock, you can pin app icons to the shelf, and running apps appear on the shelf. All other applications appear in the Launcher for which there is a  large keyboard button located where one normally finds Caps Lock. 

The fastest way to start an app is to press the Launcher button to display a search box and icons of recently used apps and then start typing the name of the app. If the highlighted icon is for the app you want to run press Enter, or tab through the displayed the app icons to select the one you want to run.

Tap the up arrow to expand the Launcher and display all of the installed apps. You can tap and hold an icon to display a menu of options that include Remove from Chrome. Unfortunately, as soon as you remove an app the Launcher closes.

There is not a quick way to expand the Launcher. The natural approach to me would be to press the Launcher button a second time to expand but that instead closes the Launcher. You can tap the up arrow or use the mouse to click, but I think there needs to be a keyboard accelerator to expand the launcher, and there might be one that I have yet to find. 

A faster way to remove a bunch of apps is to go into the Chrome browser settings, More tools, Extensions to list all of the Chrome extensions and apps which you can then click to Remove.

Android and Chrome OS apps have the same type of icon in the Launcher, so there is no way to distinguish between the two, if that matters. All Linux apps, on the other hand, appear in a separate group, and I wonder if this separation will remain when Linux apps come out of beta.

## USB-C Dock

I am going to get a USB-C dock to make it easier to connect the Pixelbook to peripherals like my monitor when I am in the home office. It looks like there are two types of docks, those that have their own power supply that then supplies power to the Pixelbook and those that requires the Pixelbook's power supply. Because I plan to leave this dock on my desk, I want one that has its own power supply. 

So far in my research I have identified two candidates: [the OWC USB-C dock](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073BDY5J5/?coliid=IRVHAT0RZVFYT&colid=2OSYVCFR78X3K&psc=0&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it) and [the Pluggable USB-C dock](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076HXWR9M/?coliid=I3S8Q3HU54TEG5&colid=2OSYVCFR78X3K&psc=0&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it); both brands are recommended by Chrome Unboxed. The Pluggable dock has more ports but the OWC dock has a SD card slot that I favor.
